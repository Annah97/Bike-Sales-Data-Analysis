# This Project involves the steps below
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Navigated through the dataset and cleaned data by removing duplicates and preprocessing within Excel to ensure data quality and consistency.
2. Build Pivot Tables and Charts: I created visualizations to uncover trends and insights related to different aspects of the dataset.
3. Bike Sales Analysis Dashboard: I developed a visual dashboard with Excel. An interactive dashboard that provides an overview of the sales  and allows users to explore key metrics and trends related to bike buying.
