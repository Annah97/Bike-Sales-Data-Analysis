# This Project involves the steps below
1. Understanding the dataset.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Navigated through the dataset and cleaned data  to remove any duplicates, spaces, and special characters, find and replace, and formatting to ensure data quality and consistency.
3. Created another column (Age Brackets) to extract additional information from the dataset.
4. Build Pivot Tables and Charts: Created Pivot tables and Charts to summarise the data and visually get quick information and make it easier to understand.
5. Finally, I built a dashboard in Excel with slicers, which allows users to interact with the data and view it in different ways.
# To explore the project

4. The "Excel Dashboard.xlsx" file contains four sheets, the "bike_buyers" sheet which is the raw data direct from the source." Working Sheet" is where I did the data cleaning and modifications of the data. And "Pivot Table" sheet is where I created the visualizations and my pivot tables and lastly is the "Dashboard" sheet, which contains an interactive dashboard .
